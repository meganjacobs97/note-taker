# Note Taker

# A full-stack note-taking application that is features dynamically updated HTML, built with JavaScript and powered by JQuery. 

## A Node command-line interface that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person

This application was built with a few goals in mind: to code with an object-oriented approach, to work with test suites, and to work with existing code. Currently, the application takes in user input about employees and generates a styled HTML page based on the information provided. 

In the future, I may modify the styling of the HTML page. Additional employee types could be added with ease as well. 

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). 

You must also download Inquirer (for prompting the user) and Jest (for the test suite), which you can do by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). 

## Usage 

From the command line, run `node index.js`. Then, answer the questions as prompted. Once finished, an HTML file called "team" will appear in the directory called "output."
