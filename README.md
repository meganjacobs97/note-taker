# Note Taker

# A fullstack note-taking application that features dynamically updated HTML, built with JavaScript and powered by JQuery. 

This application was built in order to familiarize myself with servers as well as to practice writing backend code for an existing frontend. 

Currently, the functionality allows the user to write, save, and delete notes. The application uses an express backend and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

To use this application, follow the link on the GitHub repository page. Otherwise, you can [click here](https://notetakerproj.herokuapp.com/notes). 

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). 

You must also install uniqid (for random ID generation) and Express (for running a server on your machine), which you can install by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid). 

## Usage 

To use the deployed application, simple click the "get started" button. From there, you can write notes and save them by clicking on the save icon. To delete a note, just click the trash icon. You can view notes by clicking on them from the sidebar. 

If you wish to run this application from your machine, run `node server.js` to get the server up and running. Then, open localhost:3000 in your browser.
